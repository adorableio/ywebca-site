        <h1 id="title">YWeb Career Academy</h1>
        <p> YWeb Career Academy (YWebCA) trains women and people of color, underrepresented in technology, to attain family-sustaining jobs while meeting a labor market gap. We provide instruction in front-end web development skills&mdash;including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, user experience design and project management&mdash;to 20&ndash;25 students (per session) through 400 hours of intensive instruction.</p>

        <p>Students learn in a "flipped classroom:" lessons are provided online for them to study in preparation for classroom labs. These labs provide resources and additional instruction from industry leaders and volunteer mentors, which can include answering questions, troubleshooting, brainstorming ideas, and other work pertaining to the daily focus. Labs are held Monday through Thursday evenings to accomodate students life and family schedules. </p>

        <p>Lab days follow a structure that allows for both work time and instruction from visiting guests. We begin with a stand-up: a chance to connect, share challenges, and make a plan for the work time. Sprints are held in "hot" and "cold" rooms, allowing for conversational collaboration or quiet work. Between the two daily sprints is a snack and office yoga break, supporting strong and healthy work habits. We end each lab session with a final standup to review the work accomplished that day.</p>

        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <p>We are looking for a wide range of volunteers and mentors to participate in the Academy. You may have unique knowledge about a specific area of tech development, leadership, or design&#8230; Or you may work in a broad field of skills and ideas. Bringing your expertise to our students gives them a chance to have real conversations with people working in the tech industry. Whether you want to give a prepared talk, share a skills demonstration, or spend some time answering questions from students directly, there are opportunities for you to mentor and be involved in this program.</p>

        <p>Prepared talks are scheduled as part of our lab sessions&mdash;you might share a tool or skill you use daily, or perhaps provide a conversation on the "softer" side of the industry. We welcome these talks as a part of our Thursday curriculum, but can work with you to find a time to present. If you're not interested in preparing something specific, we offer opportunities for our students to connect directly with industry leaders and thinkers at the beginning of each daily sprint session. Consider sharing how you got started in tech, your joys and challenges within the industry, and how your experience and life skills contribute to your work.</p>

        <p>We'd love it if you would stay and be available during the sprint sessions to answer further questions and connect one-on-one with interested students.</p>
