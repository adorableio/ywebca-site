        <h1 id="title">YWeb Career Academy</h1>
        <p>YWeb Career Academy (YWebCA) targets women and people of color, who are underrepresented in technology, to increase opportunities to attain family-sustaining jobs while also meeting a labor market gap. The YWebCA provides instruction in front-end web development skills through an intensive training institute. The program provides 400 hours of instruction to 20-25 individuals per class in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, user experience design and project management.</p>

        <p>Instruction for the course takes a "flipped classroom" approach where students, in conjunction with classroom instructors and industry experts, work at their own pace through online coursework. Instructors and volunteers are available to provide instructional materials and background information, answer questions, troubleshoot issues, provide additional content, and generally direct the class.</p>

        <p>Each lab day begins with a "standup" discussion in which students identify challenges they’ve experienced during the class and make co-learning plans for the day with their work groups. We then have two "sprints" of largely uninterrupted work time broken up by office yoga and a snack break. The class ends with another standup to discuss what was learned in the class that day.</p>

        <p>We currently have a "hot room" and "cold room" where teams can work in a noisy or quiet environment respectively.</p>

        <h2>Classroom Opportunities</h2>
        <p>There are two opportunities each day for mentors to participate in the class: after the initial challenges discussions and after the break. These times will offer you the opportunity to introduce yourself, give some background on your career, how you got to where you are, and why you were interested in the tech field. Topics you might cover during your remarks include: How does your life experience and accumulated skill contribute to your career success? How does your career fit into the larger tech industry? How does your organization contribute to the larger tech industry? What do you love about the tech industry? What do challenges do you face in your career? What do you wish you knew when you were starting out?</p>

        <p>If you have more to say, we'd love to hear it. Prepared presentations on anything tech-related are welcome as a goal of the class is to give the students a very broad, general, and comfortable understanding of the whole gamut of computer science, architecture, software design, and tech industry culture. You can provide a deeper dive into your domain of expertise. We welcome soft and hard talks. And you're certainly welcome to give multiple talks over the course of the program.</p>

        <p>During “sprints,” we'd like you to be available to answer questions when they arise as students work through their projects.</p>
